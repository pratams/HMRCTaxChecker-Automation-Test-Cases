HMRCTaxChecker Automation Test Cases

Created 2 Test Cases for the given scenarios using Selenium with Java and Junit Framework.
Had ideas to add utility files,data pool,object repository and create a data driven framework reading data from xls,csv data file but couldnt manage to do in the alloted timespan.
Thus restricted test cases to allow users to access base url, enter values and verify the expected outcomes.
