HMRCTaxChecker Automation Test Cases

Created 2 Test Cases for the given scenarios using Selenium with Java and Junit Framework.
Ideally wanted to come up with a framework containing reusable test cases, utility & config files,data pool,object repository and create a data driven framework reading data from xls,csv data file.Unfortunately couldnt achieve it in the alloted timescales of 1 hour.
I have therefore restricted these test cases to simply allow users to access base url, enter respective values and verify the expected outcomes of Tax Overpayment with Refunds / Validation error on the web page.
